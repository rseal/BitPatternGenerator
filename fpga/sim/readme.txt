This directory provides various test benches for the bit pattern generator modules. The completeness of each test bench is questionable at best, but provides a quick sanity check for the behavior of modules under various test conditions. Verilog input vectors are typically read in using $readmemb("filename") (binary) or $readmemh("filename") (hex). The input directory contains a utility int2bin.rb that will convert a newline delimited file containing ascii integers (the bpg format) and convert them to 1's and 0's of the proper width (16 bits) for use with the testbench. This utility is a short ruby script and can be easily altered to fit one's own needs.
