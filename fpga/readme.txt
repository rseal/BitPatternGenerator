The fpgaModule directory contains FPGA related software (Verilog) and test benches for simulating modules used in the bit 
pattern generator. The following lists contains top level directories with brief descriptions:

build     - 	contains the Makefile and friends needed to build the binary image loaded into the FPGA. Also contains a 
		timing script to generate static timing analysis.

coregen   - 	contains Verilog interface files generated by the Xilinx coregen program as well as the complxlib program 
		used to generate simulation information (this was hacked - see simulationHowto notes).

cores     - 	contains xilinx generated cores for the block and distributed ram, also contains opal kelly cores needed to 
		communicate with the FPGA.

hdl       - 	contains Verilog source code for the project. These are the files used to generate the FPGA image.

opalKelly - 	holds all opalKelly related information downloaded from www.opalkelly.com

sim       - 	contains all simulation information related to the modules defined in the Verilog source.
